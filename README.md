# Gravity-Squirrel-Lua-
Consists of:
This program is a game for mobile devices in which the user must move platforms and tilt them to get the nut to fall into the hands of a squirrel that is waiting for it on the bottom of the screen.
Notes:
All the levels are simple copies of the 1st one; they need to be modified with moving the objects to different positions to create different layouts between levels. The game is able to save the amount of progress the player has made and the settings for the music. The design of the squirrel and the tree was a contribution from my friend Kaho Mukae (for more of her work: www.facebook.com/kaho.mukae).
Tools: Corona SDK, Lua, Firefox, Windows 7
